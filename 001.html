                        <p class="white-text">My name’s Zack. Whoever, wherever you are, welcome to the first issue of&nbsp;Compile.<br/><br/>

                        Call this project a magazine, a journal, a quarterly, or anything but a blog. In short, Compile is my one-man-band attempt at bringing the craft and creativity of independent magazines to the web through curation, design and development. It’s a spotlight on the intersection of technology, humanity and culture, but at its core, it’s about recognizing and embracing the utter absurdity that&nbsp;ensues.<br/><br/>

                        When simplicity, squircles and sans-serifs become the de facto language of billion-dollar Silicon Valley software corporations, the only ethical response is to get weird. The internet is overflowing with digital news outlets and lifestyle brands churning out fresh articles on the hour, each one wrangled into an almost identical cookie-cutter template. There are, of course, logical and economic explanations for this convention and there’s certainly a vast market for the Buzzfeeds and Vox Media outlets of the world. I, however, am not here to maximize SEO, create a relatable list of GIF-based pop culture references, or review the latest $200 wireless earbuds. I made Compile because I believe that there is expressive intent in the act of curation. I believe that truly interesting content deserves a home outside of blogs and opaque algorithmically-generated newsfeeds. I believe there’s value in thoughtful and authentic DIY web design, and I figured I’d give it a shot. <br/><br/>

                        What you’re about to read, watch, listen to, and scroll through is a collection of modern oddities I’ve sought out, reorganized, and redesigned. No two layouts are the same; each article has its own voice and identity. The content itself is in no way mine, but the presentation absolutely is—think of it as a visual mixtape from me to you. The only connective tissue between these ten articles is the underlying theme of time. At the risk of rambling on or further embarrassing myself, I’ll try not to wax poetic on the concept time and let this issue speak for&nbsp;itself.<br/><br/>

                        Things have always been weird and I can only hope that they’ll just keep getting weirder. Life’s too short for the&nbsp;mundane.<br/><br/>

                        Thanks for reading, I sincerely hope you&nbsp;enjoy.<br/><br/>

                        Cheers,<br/>Zack Labadie<br/><br/>

                            <p>Yesterday, that great invertebrate in the White House signed into the law the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996" target="_blank">Telecom “Reform” Act of 1996</a>, while Tipper Gore took digital photographs of the proceedings to be included in a book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_in_Cyberspace" target="_blank">“24 Hours in&nbsp;Cyberspace.”</a></p>
                            <p>I had also been asked to participate in the creation of this book by writing something appropriate to the moment. Given the atrocity that this legislation would seek to inflict on the Net, I decided it was as good a time as any to dump some tea in the virtual&nbsp;harbor.</p>
                            <p>After all, the Telecom “Reform” Act, passed in the Senate with only 5 dissenting votes, makes it unlawful, and <span>punishable by a $250,000 to say “shit” online.</span> Or, for that matter, to say any of the other 7 dirty words prohibited in broadcast media. Or to discuss abortion openly. Or to talk about any bodily function in any but the most clinical&nbsp;terms.</p>
                            <p>It attempts to place more restrictive constraints on the conversation in Cyberspace than presently exist in the Senate cafeteria, where I have dined and heard colorful indecencies spoken by United States senators on every occasion I did. This bill was enacted upon us by people who haven’t the slightest idea who we are or where our conversation is being conducted. It is, as my good friend and Wired Editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Rossetto" target="_blank">Louis Rossetto</a> put it, as though “the illiterate could tell you what to&nbsp;read.”</p>
                            <p><span>Well, fuck them.</span></p>
                            <p>Or, more to the point, let us now take our leave of them. They have declared war on Cyberspace. Let us show them how cunning, baffling, and powerful we can be in our own defense. I have written something (with characteristic grandiosity) that I hope will become one of many means to this end. If you find it useful, I hope you will pass it on as widely as possible. You can leave my name off it if you like, because I don’t care about the credit. I really don’t. But I do hope this cry will echo across Cyberspace, changing and growing and self-replicating, until it becomes a great shout equal to the idiocy they have just inflicted upon us. I give you... <span>A Declaration of the Independence of&nbsp;Cyberspace.</span></p>

                            <p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. <span>You are not welcome among us.</span> You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to&nbsp;fear.</p>
                            <p>Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. <span>Cyberspace does not lie within your borders.</span> Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions. You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your&nbsp;impositions.</p>
                            <p>You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don’t exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract" target="_blank">Social Contract</a>. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. <span>Our world is different.</span> Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies&nbsp;live.</p>
                            <p>We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are based on matter. There is no matter here. Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will&nbsp;emerge.</p>
                            <p>Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to&nbsp;impose.</p>
                            <p>In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us. <span>You are terrified of your own children</span>, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. <span>We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings&nbsp;beat.</span></p>
                            <p>In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media. Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. <span>The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to&nbsp;accomplish.</span></p>
                            <p>These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
                            <p>We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.</p>
                            <p>May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made&nbsp;before.</p>

                            <p>Got a sec?<br/><br/>

                            Michelangelo Capraro doesn't-- not anymore. These days the 24-year-old Web designer from Santa Monica, Calif., is living on Internet&nbsp;time.<br/><br/>

                            On a typical workday he rises at 700 beats. By 750 beats, he's in the office checking e-mail. At 900 beats, he faxes a lunch order to the Italian deli around the corner, which, he says, takes about half an hour to prepare. "Oops, I mean 20 beats," he corrects himself. At 170 beats, he logs off his PC and heads&nbsp;home.<br/><br/>

                            The "beats" that govern Capraro's life are the brainchild of <a href="https://www.swatch.com/en_us/" target="_blank">Swatch</a>, the cheeky Swiss watchmaker that is to the staid business of horology what Dennis Rodman is to basketball. No longer satisfied with keeping time, Swatch wants to reinvent it. The reason: In the Internet Age, conventional clocks don't cut&nbsp;it.<br/><br/>

                            Say you're cruising the Net in Baltimore and want to chat online with Web buddies, or clients, who live in Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, Seattle and Johannesburg. How do you decide what time to convene? If you suggest 10 p.m., is that 10 p.m. Eastern time? Or 10 p.m. Buenos Aires time? If so, what time is that in your time and everybody's&nbsp;else's?</p>
                            <div class="swatch-globe">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                            <a href="https://www.swatch.com/en_us/internet-time/" target="_blank">Swatch's solution</a>: Do away with time zones altogether, and create one uniform time around the globe. "For centuries one big measuring stick has been the sun," says Yann Gamard, president of Swatch Group USA. "We've created another measuring&nbsp;stick."<br/><br/>

                            The company divided the day into 1,000 "beats," each equal to 86.4 seconds. It also moved the prime meridian from Greenwich, England, to Swatch headquarters in Biel, Switzerland. Thus, the global Internet day starts at midnight "Biel Mean Time," or simply "@ 000" in catchy Internet time&nbsp;notation.<br/><br/>

                            The ultimate marketing gimmick? You bet! says&nbsp;Gamard.<br/><br/>

                            Just so happens the company has created a new line of funky $70 watches called Swatch Beat. Aimed squarely at the DotCom generation, the six garishly colored digital timepieces have cyber-savvy names such as "Download," "Netsurfer," "Webmaster" and "Provider." They tick off time in both old-fashioned hours and Swatch beats. And for those who wallow in millennium angst, they even automatically count down the days until&nbsp;Y2K.

                                Despite its blatant commercialism, Internet time is catching on. Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's famed <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/about/mission-history/" target="_blank">Media Lab</a> and author of the influential book "Being Digital," has lent his support to the Internet time&nbsp;movement.<br/><br/>

                                "Cyberspace has no seasons and no night and day," he proclaimed last fall at Swatch's unveiling. "In the future, for many people, real time will be Internet&nbsp;time."<br/><br/>

                                CNN, the 24-hour news network, now displays both standard and Internet time on its highly trafficked Web site (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/" target="_blank">www.cnn.com)</a>. Dozens of other sites have followed its&nbsp;lead.<br/><br/>

                                To encourage them, Swatch is offering free Internet time clock software for PCs on its own Web site (<a href="https://www.swatch.com/en_us/" target="_blank">www.swatch.com</a>). By the end of February, when Swatch last counted, almost 130,000 people had downloaded it. Other software publishers have created Internet time clock software for Macintosh computers, Palm Pilots and other digital&nbsp;devices.<br/><br/>

                                Martina Overby, a 29-year-old network administrator at Pioneer Electronics Service Inc. in Palm Beach, Calif., installed the Internet time clock on more than 30 computers around her building. "Everybody loves it," she says. The company handles repairs for its Japanese parent, consumer electronics giant Pioneer, and so employees are often in touch with colleagues and clients in Asia. Internet time makes it easier to schedule meetings, Overby&nbsp;says.<br/><br/>

                                Ryan Thiessen, a third-year student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, created a Web site devoted to Internet time (http://ryan.thiessen.com/swatch). "It takes a while to get used to," says Thiessen, but "once you have the Swatch watch and use it, it starts to make&nbsp;sense."<br/><br/>

                                Some historians say the new clock isn't as cuckoo as it may seem. In fact, as times change, so does time.<br/><br/>

                                "As communities get more interconnected, they tend to adopt more standardized forms of time," says Michael O'Malley, associate professor of American history at George Mason University. "And that's entirely a function of&nbsp;technology."<br/><br/>

                                In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Watch-History-American-Time/dp/1560986727" target="_blank">"Keeping Pace: A History of American Time,"</a> O'Malley points out that for centuries the only time that mattered was "local time," which varied significantly from place to place. When it was noon in New York, it might be 11: 52 a.m. in Philadelphia and 12: 34 p.m. in&nbsp;Boston.<br/><br/>

                                The growth of technologies such as the steam engine and the telegraph changed that. Suddenly, it was possible to send a message across the country in a matter of seconds, and travel hundreds of miles in a day. As these 19th-century innovations brought the world closer, the shortcomings of local time grew more&nbsp;apparent.

                                As the transcontinental railroad was nearing completion in 1869, organizers planned to commemorate the event by driving a golden spike through the line in Promontory, Utah. Railroad officials, wanting it to be a nationwide media event, hired a telegrapher to tap his key when the spike entered the ground.<br/><br/>

                                It was a flop. The telegraph clicked in Promontory at 12: 45 p.m. But Virginia City marked it at 12: 30. San Francisco heard it at "precisely" 11: 46 or 11: 44, depending on which paper one consulted. Washington, D.C., recorded it for history as 2: 47.<br/><br/>

                                <img src="images/001c_swatch/001c_time-bookcover.gif" alt="Cover of Keeping Pace: A History of American Time" width="120px" height="auto" class="swatch-book lazy">

                                Pressure from railroad companies and the scientific community led in 1883 to the adoption of four standard time zones in the U.S. The next year, the International Meridian Conference formally sliced the globe into 24 time zones, making Greenwich, England, the site of the prime&nbsp;meridian.<br/><br/>

                                For Internet time to become official, Swatch would need the blessing of the <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/about-us/" target="_blank">Bureau International des Poids et Mesures</a>. The international body of standards makers based outside Paris is responsible for all matters of weights and&nbsp;measures.<br/><br/>

                                But Swatch officials say they have no intention of doing so. "We don't lobby people, it wouldn't be our style," says Swatch's Gamard. "If the public likes it, they take&nbsp;it."<br/><br/>

                                Critics say it's unlikely standards makers would consider a proposal that history has already snubbed&nbsp;anyway.<br/><br/>

                                In 1792 French revolutionaries tried something called <a href="http://www.metricclock.com/" target="_blank">metric time</a>. Days were divided into 10 hours. Each hour had 100 minutes and each minute 100 seconds. Do the math and it turns out the Swatch beat is nothing but the old metric minute: 86.4&nbsp;seconds.<br/><br/>

                                New watches and clocks were made, some of which survive today. But le peuple panned the idea. By 1806, Napoleon decided enough was enough and reverted to traditional&nbsp;timekeeping.<br/><br/>

                                Critics of Internet time also point out that a perfectly good solution to the time-zone dilemma already exists. Ham-radio operators and the military have for years used Greenwich Mean Time-- or what the military calls "zulu" time -- to solve the problem of coordinating activities in different time zones. So an Army radio operator stationed in Japan listening to Russian radio transmissions might mark his reports to the Pentagon not in Japan time, Russian time or Eastern time, but in whatever the time was at the Greenwich&nbsp;meridian.<br/><br/>

                                Devotees of Internet time are&nbsp;undeterred.<br/><br/>

                                "Right now people still look at you a little bit funny when you use it," says Thiessen. "In five to 10 years, this is going to be common&nbsp;sense."

                        <p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>first read Ray Kurzweil’s book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Spiritual_Machines" target="_blank"><i>The Age of Spiritual Machines</i></a>, in 2006, a few years after I dropped out of Bible school and stopped believing in God. I was living alone in Chicago’s southern industrial sector and working nights as a cocktail waitress. I was not well. Beyond the people I worked with, I spoke to almost no one. I clocked out at three each morning, went to after-hours bars, and came home on the first train of the morning, my head pressed against the window so as to avoid the spectre of my reflection appearing and disappearing in the blackened&nbsp;glass.</p>
                        <p>At Bible school, I had studied a branch of theology that divided all of history into successive stages by which God revealed his truth. We were told we were living in the “Dispensation of Grace”, the penultimate era, which precedes that glorious culmination, the “Millennial Kingdom”, when the clouds part and Christ returns and life is altered beyond comprehension. But I no longer believed in this future. More than the death of God, I was mourning the dissolution of this narrative, which envisioned all of history as an arc bending towards a moment of final redemption. It was a loss that had fractured even my experience of time. My hours had become non-hours. Days seemed to unravel and circle back on&nbsp;themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Kurzweil book belonged to a bartender at the jazz club where I worked. He lent it to me a couple of weeks after I’d seen him reading it and asked him – more out of boredom than genuine curiosity – what it was about. I read the first pages on the train home from work, in the grey and ghostly hours before&nbsp;dawn.</p>
                        <p>“The 21st century will be different,” Kurzweil wrote. “The human species, along with the computational technology it created, will be able to solve age-old problems … and will be in a position to change the nature of mortality in a postbiological&nbsp;future.”</p>
                        <p>Like the theologians at my Bible school, Kurzweil, who is now a director of engineering at Google and a leading proponent of a philosophy called <a href="http://humanityplus.org/about/mission/" target="_blank">transhumanism</a>, had his own historical narrative. He divided all of evolution into successive epochs. We were living in the fifth epoch, when human intelligence begins to merge with technology. Soon we would reach the “Singularity”, the point at which we would be transformed into what Kurzweil called “Spiritual Machines”. We would transfer or “resurrect” our minds onto supercomputers, allowing us to live forever. Our bodies would become incorruptible, immune to disease and decay, and we would acquire knowledge by uploading it to our brains. Nanotechnology would allow us to remake Earth into a terrestrial paradise, and then we would migrate to space, terraforming other planets. Our powers, in short, would be&nbsp;limitless.</p>

                        <p>It’s difficult to account for the totemic power I ascribed to the book. I carried it with me everywhere, tucked in the recesses of my backpack, though I was paranoid about being seen with it in public. It seemed to me a work of alchemy or a secret gospel. It is strange, in retrospect, that I was not more sceptical of these promises. I’d grown up in the kind of millenarian sect of Christianity where pastors were always throwing out new dates for the Rapture. But Kurzweil’s prophecies seemed different because they were bolstered by science. Moore’s law held that computer processing power doubled every two years, meaning that technology was developing at an exponential rate. Thirty years ago, a computer chip contained 3,500 transistors. Today it has more than 1bn. By 2045, Kurzweil predicted, the technology would be inside our bodies. At that moment, the arc of progress would curve into a vertical&nbsp;line.

                        <p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>any transhumanists such as Kurzweil contend that they are carrying on the legacy of the Enlightenment – that theirs is a philosophy grounded in reason and empiricism, even if they do lapse occasionally into metaphysical language about “transcendence” and “eternal life”. As I read more about the movement, I learned that most transhumanists are atheists who, if they engage at all with monotheistic faith, defer to the familiar antagonisms between science and religion. “The greatest threat to humanity’s continuing evolution,” writes the transhumanist Simon Young, “is theistic opposition to Superbiology in the name of a belief system based on blind faith in the absence of&nbsp;evidence.”</p>
